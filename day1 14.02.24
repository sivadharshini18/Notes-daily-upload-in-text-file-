RAM- Randaom Access Memory
       It is a primary memory storage.
       secondary memory -non volatile memory
       Static RAM is is faster than Dynamic RAM
Types of RAM:
      SRAM-made of flip flop
      DRAM-made of capacitors
      It is volatile memory
ARM:
  cortext A- Appplication
  cortex R- Real time Application
  cortext M- Microcontroller(process only)
CPU- knows only addition
Bus- Used to communicate between CPU up computer (median)
Pheripherals:
Ex
1)GPIO - It is used to communicate the outside environment
2)UART
3)I2C
4)SPI
The pheripherals are travel by System Bus.
GPIO(Genral Purpose Input Output)
    It is used to read digital signal
    Issuing interrupts
    Generating triggers for external components

GPIO PIN:
  value consists of one of two voltage setting we can program each PIN
GPIO PORT:
   Many pin Join together is called port
Multiplexing:
   We can act pin as GPIO,SPI ect is called multiplexing
IC floating State:
    you not pretric the level is high or low
    It is used to stable the pull up or pull down
GPIO Output mode:
     open drain state
     It is always show Zero
     when the tansistor is on the pin is pulled to the ground
     when the transistor is off push pull configuration
  To access the GPIO a port we have to activate the clock 
    0- led will not glow
    1- led glow
    ODR - Output Data Register
